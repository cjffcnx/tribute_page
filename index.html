      <p data-aos="fade-down"  id="whowashe" style="margin: 0 130px; line-height:2rem;"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong> was an American inventor, designer, and entrepreneur who was the cofounder, chief executive, and chairman of <strong>Apple Inc.</strong> Born in <strong>1955</strong> to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before cofounding <strong>Apple</strong> with <strong>Steve Wozniak</strong> in <strong>1976</strong>. Jobs left the company in <strong>1985</strong>, launching <strong>Pixar Animation Studios</strong>, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. The tech giant’s revolutionary products, which include the <strong>iPhone</strong>, <strong>iPad</strong>, and <strong>iPod</strong>, have dictated the evolution of modern technology. Jobs died in <strong>2011</strong> following a long battle with <strong>pancreatic cancer</strong>.</p>

        <h3 style="background-color: rgba(25, 85, 154, 0.575); font-style: italic; margin: 20px 0; line-height: 2rem;">Early life</h3>
        <p data-aos="fade-down"  style="margin:0 130px;line-height: 2rem;"><strong>Steve Jobs</strong> grew up with his adoptive family in <strong>Mountain View, California</strong>, which later became known as <strong>Silicon Valley</strong>. As a child, he was very curious, sometimes leading to accidents like <b>burning his hand</b> by putting a pin in an electrical socket and swallowing poison. His mother, <b>Clara</b>, taught him to read before he started school.</p>

<p data-aos="fade-down"  style="margin:0 130px; line-height:2rem;">Jobs and his father, <strong>Paul</strong>, spent time in their garage working on electronics. Paul showed him how to take apart and rebuild things, which gave Jobs <strong>confidence</strong> and <b>mechanical skills</b>.</p>

<p data-aos="fade-down"  style="margin:0 130px; line-height:2rem;">Although Jobs was smart, he found school boring and often caused trouble. His fourth-grade teacher had to <b>bribe</b> him to study, but he tested so well that his school wanted him to <strong>skip grades</strong>, though his parents didn’t agree.</p>

<p data-aos="fade-down"  style="margin:0 130px; line-height:2rem;">In high school, Jobs joined a tech club at <strong>Hewlett-Packard (HP)</strong>, where he saw a computer for the first time and got a summer job. It was here that he met <strong>Steve Wozniak</strong>, who later co-founded <b>Apple</b> with him.</p>

<p  data-aos="fade-down" style="margin:0 130px; line-height:2rem;">After high school, Jobs went to <strong>Reed College</strong> in Oregon but dropped out after six months. He stayed around the campus, taking creative classes like <b>calligraphy</b>, which influenced his later work with typography.</p>

<p data-aos="fade-down" style="margin:0 130px; line-height:2rem;">In 1974, Jobs worked at <strong>Atari</strong> as a video game designer, but soon left to travel to <b>India</b>, searching for <strong>spiritual enlightenment</strong> and experimenting with psychedelic drugs.</p>

<ol data-aos="fade-down"  style="margin: 0 130px; list-style-type: decimal; line-height:3rem;">
  <li><strong>“Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?”</strong> [Jobs inviting an executive to join Apple]</li>
  <li><strong>“It’s better to be a pirate than join the Navy.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“In my perspective... science and computer science is a liberal art. It’s something everyone should know how to use, at least, and harness in their life.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough. It’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“There’s an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love—‘I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been’—and we’ve always tried to do that at Apple.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“You can’t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they’ll want something new.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“I think humans are basically tool builders, and the computer is the most remarkable tool we’ve ever built.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“You just make the best product you can, and you don’t put it out until you feel it’s right.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“Things don’t have to change the world to be important.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“I would trade all of my technology for an afternoon with Socrates.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful—that’s what matters to me.”</strong></li>
  <li><strong>“I like to believe there’s an afterlife. I like to believe the accumulated wisdom doesn’t just disappear when you die, but somehow, it endures. But maybe it’s just like an on/off switch and click—and you’re gone. Maybe that’s why I didn’t like putting on/off switches on Apple devices.”</strong></li>
